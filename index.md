# About Me and This Blog
Hi there, I'm Mayu, and I work as a software engineer with experience in both backend and frontend development.

The primary purpose of this blog is to serve as a study record of my journey in improving my algorithmic skills, particularly on platforms like LeetCode. I began this blog because, despite my background in software engineering, I initially lacked confidence in tackling algorithmic challenges.

As someone who wasn't naturally strong in algorithms, I decided to take a systematic approach and use LeetCode as a tool to enhance my skills. This blog serves as a record of my progress, and please note that this blog includes solutions to LeetCode's easy problems, aiming to provide a resource for others on a similar learning path.

Thank you for visiting, and I hope you find the content here valuable in your own journey of algorithmic improvement.
